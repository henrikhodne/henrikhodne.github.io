title: Travis Lite
---

Lately I've been going through a lot of the issues in [Travis CI][travis-ci]'s
issue tracker. After seeing a lot of issues being closed (and closing several
myself), I see some things being requested a lot, but that just aren't
something that would fit with Travis (at least not right now). One of those
things is a more light-weight client.

The Travis CI web client is one of the reasons I love Travis as much as I do.
There's no need to refresh, you just go to your repository page and see the
build stream in as you (or someone else) pushes commits. However, not all
browsers and computers can handle such a JavaScript-intense page.

This inspired me to create more lightweight version of the Travis webpage, and
I'm happy to announce that it is now live: [Travis Lite][travis-lite]. Travis
Lite is built on the [Travis CI API][travis-api] that the Travis team has been
awesome enough to provide.

Travis Lite is till a work in progress, but you can see the list of the latest
builds, as well as the latest builds for a repository. The goal is for all of
the Travis URL endpoints to be implemented, so you can just replace the
"travis-ci.org" part of the URL with "travis-lite.com".

The app is [open source][github-travis-lite], and contributions are greatly
welcomed.
